##  Personal Portfolio Website

My name is Tushar Rai, a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in frontend development and UI/UX design. I enjoy building intuitive, responsive user interfaces and designing user experiences that are both beautiful and functional.

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **Angular** and **TailwindCSS**. I’ve learned a lot building it — and if you explore the code, you might pick up something useful too.
